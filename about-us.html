     <p class="intro">This is the story of how we got Adika.</p>
     <h3 class="author">About Akida and us!</h3>
    <p>Adika was born with a heredity condition that caused a deformity, and the man trying to sell him outside of a grocery store simply left him there when nobody wanted him. Luckily, a kind lady brought him to a shelter, and thanks to California Animal Rescue, he was able to find Karen Rogers, who offered to house him temporarily then quickly fell in love with him and adopted him herself.</p>

    <p> Initially he had some trouble getting around, but three surgeries later, he walks on three legs with ease and lives like a puppy in a five-year-old dog’s body. He lives up to the name T-Rex by tearing into his toys, chasing the other dogs around the house, and playing fetch like his life depends on it. He’s also offered Rogers a ton of support. After all, empathy is one of the superpowers all dogs have. “My mom passed away three years ago from lung cancer; she was diagnosed and died within eight months,” Rogers says.</p>

    <p> “Adika would sit on my lap for hours in the evening, as I went through my mourning time. He has so much energy, but if I was sitting at my computer, he would curl up on my lap and just let me be sad.” Adika is also philanthropic, taking part in Paws for Love every year, using his tail instead of his paws (like the other dogs) to paint pictures and raise money for their cause. “They support rescues by awarding grants to them to help with vet bills,” Rogers says. “They paid $1,000 towards Adika’s surgery, so every year, T paints for them and they sell it at the gala. He tries to help them raise money by showing people how donated money is used to help dogs and cats.” Check out all of the other health benefits of owning a dog.</p>
